The data should be a CSV file with these columns:
date: the date and time when the record was logged.
UTRGRID100: the grid ID that shows the location.
seconde: how many seconds of activity occurred.
is_hotspot: a 1 if it’s a hotspot, and a 0 if it’s not.


I added the dataset I used, I didnt had time to implement the aggregation, so for now just use that dataset, its based on the aggregation Jesse used on the heatmap, just added wether something is a hotspot. Treshold was 10 minutes. Sorry uwu

Features
Lagged Features:
Lagged features let you see what happened before

lagged_seconde: how many seconds were logged in the previous time step for the same grid.
lagged_is_hotspot: the hotspot status (1 or 0) from the previous time step.

Rolling Features:
Rolling features give you averages or sums over a recent period, I chose a window of 3, but it can be changed.

rolling_mean_seconde: the average seconds spent over the last three records.
rolling_hotspot_count: the number of times it was a hotspot in the last three records.

Temporal Features:
day_of_week: which day of the week it was (Monday=0, Sunday=6).
month: the month number.
Lagged versions of day_of_week and month: these look back at the previous day or month.
Steps

Feature Engineering:
Add lagged and rolling features to use patterns from past records. Pull out day of the week and month for more context.

Balancing the Data:
Use SMOTE to handle class imbalance, so the model sees enough examples of both hotspots and non-hotspots.

Splitting the Data:
Divide the data into training and test sets, making sure both sets have similar proportions of hotspots and non-hotspots.

Model Evaluation:
Check how well the model is doing by measuring things like precision (how many predicted hotspots were correct) and recall (how many real hotspots the model found).

Cross-Validation:
Test the model on different parts of the data to confirm it works well across the whole dataset.
